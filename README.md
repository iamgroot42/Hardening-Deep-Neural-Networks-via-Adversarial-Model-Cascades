### Working

- Adversary gets hold of unlabelled data (not overlapping with target)
- Make queries to black-box model, use results to create dataset.
- Using this collected data, train a proxy network.
- Generate adversarial examples for the trained proxy network.
- Calculate error rate on the target network, for images generated by the proxy adversarial network.

### Attacks present

- FGSM
- JSMA
- Virtual
- Carlini
- Deepfool
- Madry
- Elastic

### Setting it up

- `bash prepare.sh` to download required data and models
- Make sure your system has basic ML dependencies like Keras and Tensorflow
- `bash test*.sh <dataset> <target_model> <proxy_model>`, where * denotes anoy of the 7 attacks given in the repo.
- `bash genericBagging.sh <dataset> <path_to_seed_model> <new_folder_for_bag> <cumulative data for finetuning?> <path_to_file_containing_order_of_attacks> <transfer_parameters_per_bag?>`
For example, `bash genericBagging.sh mnist PlainModel MYBAG/ no ORDER no`
