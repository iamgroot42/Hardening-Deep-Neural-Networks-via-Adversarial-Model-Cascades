### Working

- Use a data-set collected by the adversary.
- Make queries to black-box model, use results to create synthetic dataset (using Jacobian based data augmentation).
- Using the collected data, train a proxy network.
- Generate adversarial examples for the trained proxy network.
- Calculate misclassification rate on the blackbox network, for images generated by the adversarial network.


### Progress
- For CNN (on MNIST), using Fast Gradient Sign Method for creating adversary.
- Using handpicked features (visual bag of words using SIFT/HOG features) to create networks.
- Using an autoencoder to summarize the image and then pass it to an MLP.
- Use features from CNN to be passed on to a SVM


### Using it

- ` cd Scripts`
- `bash automate.sh <EXAMPLES_PER_CLASS>`
